# TODO: This needs a GUI with toggles, or I need a way to install these system-wide at built time. 
# TODO: Users should be able to run this and pick what to install anytime.
# TODO: This should also handle https://rpmfusion.org/Howto/Secure%20Boot.
# TODO: The GUI will use /usr/local/share/pureblue/suggested stuff to list suggestions
# TODO: Also the GUI should detect if the thing is already installed or not, so untoggleing and apply should remove stuff.
# TODO: ExtensionManager selection should select only one.
# TODO: it should also suggest flathub as default
