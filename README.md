# pureblue

Trying to make my own Silverblue image.

Intended vanilla Fedora GNOME experience, with some thoughtful, unopinionated
tweaks designed to be easy to use by everyone. Ready-to-use images will also be
available for various hardware configurations, for those who need them.

Vanilla GNOME experience aligned with the GNOME Desktop philosophy.
