# pureblue

Trying to make my own Silverblue image.

Intended vanilla Fedora GNOME experience, with some thoughtful, unopinionated
tweaks designed to be easy to use by everyone. Ready-to-use images will also be
available for various hardware configurations, for those who need them.

Vanilla GNOME experience aligned with the GNOME Desktop philosophy.

ok having issues while building akmod nvidia modules with asus-kernel, issue is caused by dnf compat thing based on logs but there might be more issues? idk.
im not invested in this enough to fix it rn.
maybe it will fix itself.
also i dont have time.
so this will just sit here for now.
